For men are never beguiled by women,
She would rather go quickly to hell than tell it to her neighbor!
You would say, they are proud!’
I will rise while you are sleeping.
The man came home when dinner time came,
Keep our children well and don’t let them weep.
When you are in the church, my child, see to it that you are both meek and mild,
Don’t gossip with family nor friends.
My dear daughter, take heed of this.
Don’t go to the tavern,
Don’t go to wrestling matches,
Stay at home, my dear daughter.
Make sure you go to bed on time;
Rising early is good medicine.
Be well-disposed, both meek and mild,
Since his lord was twenty years of age.
Whoever must repeat a story after someone,
He must repeat as closely as ever he knows how
Every single word, if it be in his power,
Although he may speak ever so rudely and freely,
Or else he must tell his tale inaccurately,
Or make up things, or find new words.
He may not refrain from  although he were his brother;
He must as well say one word as another.
Christ himself spoke very plainly in holy writ,
And you know well it is no rudeness.
Also Plato says, whosoever knows how to read him,
The words must be closely related to the deed.
Also I pray you to forgive it to me,
Although I have not set folk in order of their rank
Here in this tale, as they should stand.
My wit is short, you can well understand.
Our Host made great hospitality to everyone of us,
And to the supper he set us straightway.
He served us with victuals of the best sort;
The wine was strong, and it well pleased us to drink.
OUR HOST was an impressive man indeed
to be a master of ceremonies in a hall.
He was a large man with prominent eyes --
There was no better business man in Cheapside --
Bold of his speech, and wise, and well mannered,
And he lacked nothing at all of the qualities proper to a man.
Also moreover he was a right merry man;
And after supper he began to be merry,
And spoke of mirth among other things,
When we had paid our bills,
And said thus: "Now, gentlemen, truly,
You are right heartily welcome to me;
For by my word, if I shall not lie
I saw not this year so merry a company
At one time in this lodging as is now.
I would gladly make you happy, if I knew how.
And I have just now thought of an amusement,
To give you pleasure, and it shall cost nothing.
"You go to Canterbury -- God give you success,
May the blessed martyr give you your reward!
And well I know, as you go by the way,
You intend to tell tales and to amuse yourselves;
For truly, it is no comfort nor mirth
To ride by the way dumb as a stone;
And therefore I will make a game for you,
As I said before, and provide you some pleasure.
And if pleases you all unanimously
To be subject to my judgment,
And to do as I shall tell you,
Tomorrow, when you ride by the way,
Now, by the soul of my father who is dead,
Unless you be merry, I will give you my head!
Hold up your hands, without more speech."
Our decision was not long to seek out.
It seemed to us it was not worthwhile to deliberate on it,
And granted his request without more discussion,
And asked him to say his decision as it pleased him.
"Gentlemen," said he, "now listen for the best course of action;
But, I pray yow, do not take it in disdain
This is the point, to speak briefly and clearly,
That each of yow, to make our way seem short by this means,
Must tell two tales in this journey
On the way to Canterbury, that is what I mean,
And on the homeward trip he shall tell two others,
About adventures that in old times have happened.
And whoever of you who does best of all --
That is to say, who tells in this case
Tales of best moral meaning and most pleasure --
Shall have a supper at the cost of us all
Here in this place, sitting by this post,
When we come back from Canterbury.
And to make you the more merry,
I will myself gladly ride with you,
Entirely at my own cost, and be your guide;
And whosoever will not accept my judgment
Shall pay all that we spend by the way.
And if you grant that it be so,
Tell me straightway, without more words,
And I will get ready early for this."
This thing was granted, and our oaths sworn
With very glad hearts, and prayed him also
That he would consent to do so,
And that he would be our governor,
And judge and score keeper of our tales,
And set a supper at a certain price,
And we will be ruled as he wishes
In every respect; and thus unanimously
We are accorded to his judgment.
And thereupon the wine was fetched immediately;
We drank, and each one went to rest,
Without any longer tarrying.
In the morning, when day began to spring,
Our Host arose, and was the rooster of us all
And gathered us together all in a flock,
And forth we rode at little more than a walk
Unto the Watering of Saint Thomas;
And there our Host stopped his horse
And said, "Gentlemen, listen, if you please.
You know your agreement, and I remind you of it.
If what you said last night agrees with what you say this morning,
Let's see now who shall tell the first tale.
As ever I may drink wine or ale,
Whosoever may be rebel to my judgment
Shall pay for all that is spent by the way.
Now draw straws, before we depart further
He who has the shortest shall begin.
Sir Knight," said he, "my master and my lord,
Now draw a straw, for that is my decision.
Come nearer," he said, "my lady Prioress.
And you, sir Clerk, let be your modesty,
And study not; lay hand to  every man!"
Every person began straightway to draw,
And shortly to tell as it was,
Were it by chance, or destiny, or luck,
The truth is this: the draw fell to the Knight,
For which everyone was very happy and glad,
And he must tell his tale, as was reasonable,
By our previous promise and by formal agreement,
As you have heard; what more words are needed?
And when this good man saw that it was so,
Like one who was wise and obedient
To keep his agreement by his free assent,
He said, "Since I must begin the game,
What! Welcome be the draw, in God's name!
Now let us ride, and listen to what I say."
And with that word we rode forth on our way,
And he began with a truly merry demeanor
To tell his tale straightway, and said as you may hear.

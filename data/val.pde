What do you have to do, but sit here at home.
When I lie awake all night with our child, I wake up in the morning and find our house in disarray.
Then I make butter later in the day.
You go to your neighbor’s house, repeatedly,
Then, I milk our livestock and turn them out into the field.
While you sleep soundly,
the wife had laid her meat to marinate:
Therefore, woman, get ready,
Yet I don’t get any kind words when I have. done that.
Fair words never break bone,
Have a fair appearance, my dear daughter,
Do not change your face with great laughter
Be, daughter, a good housewife,
Do not be together in company with women of evil names
And if your husband is away from home, do not let your servants go idle
Do not forget them if you are able,
Because a child is better unborn than untaught, so goes the proverb.
Therefore Almighty God in a throne protects us all, both during the evening and the morning;
There was no man who could find him in arrears.
There was no farm manager, nor herdsman, nor other servant,
Whose trickery and treachery he did not know;
They were afraid of him as of the plague.
His dwelling was very nicely situated upon an heath;
His place was shaded by green trees.
He could buy property better than his lord could.
He was secretly very richly provided.
He well knew how to please his lord subtly,
By giving and lending him some of his lord's own possessions,
And have thanks, and also a coat and hood
In youth he had learned a good craft:
He was a very good craftsman, a carpenter.
This Reeve sat upon a very good horse
That was all dapple gray and was called Scot.
He had on a long outer coat of dark blue,
And by his side he wore a rusty sword.
Of Northfolk was this Reeve of whom I tell,
Near to a town men call Bawdeswelle.
He had his coat hitched up and belted, like a friar,
And ever he rode as the last of our company.
There was a SUMMONER with us in that place,
Who had a fire-red cherubim's face,
For it was pimpled and discolored, with swollen eyelids.
He was as hot and lecherous as a sparrow,
With black, scabby brows and a beard with hair fallen out.
Children were afraid of his face.
There was no mercury, lead monoxide, nor sulphur,
Borax, white lead, nor any oil of tarter,
Nor ointment that would cleanse and burn,
That could cure him of his white pustules,
Nor of the knobs sitting on his cheeks.
He well loved garlic, onions, and also leeks,
And to drink strong wine, red as blood;
Then he would speak and cry out as if he were crazy.
And when he had drunk deeply of the wine,
Then he would speak no word but Latin.
He had a few legal terms, two or three,
That he had learned out of some text of ecclesiastical law --
That is no wonder, he heard it all the day;
And also you know well how a jay
Can call out "Walter" as well as the pope can.
But whoever knew how to examine him in other matters,
he had used up all his learning;
Always "The question is, what point of the law applies?" he would cry.
He was a fine rascal and a kind one;
One could not find a better fellow.
For a quart of wine he would allow
A good fellow to have his concubine
For twelve months, and excuse him completely;
Secretly he also knew how to pull off a clever trick.
And if he found anywhere a good fellow,
He would teach him to have no awe
Of the archdeacon's curse in such a case,
Unless a man's soul were in his purse;
For in his purse he would be punished.
"Purse is the archdeacon's hell," he said.
But well I know he lied right certainly;
Each guilty man ought to be afraid of excommunication,
For excommunication will slay just as forgiveness saves,
And let him also beware of a Significavit
In his control he had as he pleased
The young people of the diocese,
And knew their secrets, and was the adviser of them all.
He had set a garland upon his heed,
As large as if it were for the sign of a tavern
He had made himself a shield of a cake.
With him there rode a fine PARDONER
Of Rouncivale, his friend and his companion,
Who had come straight from the court of Rome.
Very loud he sang "Come hither, love, to me!"
This Summoner harmonized with him in a strong bass;
There was never a trumpet of half so great a sound.
This Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,
But smooth it hung as does a clump of flax;
By small strands hung such locks as he had,
And he spread them over his shoulders;
But thin it lay, by strands one by one.
But to make an attractive appearance, he wore no hood,
For it was trussed up in his knapsack.
It seemed to him that he rode in the very latest style;
With hair unbound, save for his cap, he rode all bare-headed.
He had glaring eyes such as has a hare.
He had sewn a Veronica upon his cap.
Before him in his lap, his knapsack,
Brimful of pardons come all fresh from Rome.
He had a voice as small as a goat has.
He had no beard, nor never would have;
It was as smooth as if it were recently shaven.
I believe he was a eunuch or a homosexual.
But as to his craft, from Berwick to Ware
There was no other pardoner like him.
For in his pouch he had a pillow-case,
Which he said was Our Lady's veil;
He said he had a piece of the sail
That Saint Peter had, when he went
Upon the sea, until Jesus Christ took him.
He had a cross of latten covered with stones,
And in a glass container he had pigs' bones.
But with these relics, when he found
A poor parson dwelling in the countryside,
In one day he got himself more money
Than the parson got in two months;
And thus, with feigned flattery and tricks,
He made fools of the parson and the people.
But truly to tell at the last,
He was in church a noble ecclesiast.
He well knew how to read a lesson or a story,
But best of all he sang an Offertory;
For he knew well, when that song was sung,
He must preach and well smooth his speech
To win silver, as he very well knew how;
Therefore he sang the more merrily and loud.
Now have I told you truly, briefly,
The rank, the dress, the number, and also the cause
Why this company was assembled
In Southwark at this fine hostelry
That is called the Tabard, close by the Bell.
But now it is time to tell to you
How we conducted ourselves that same night,
When we had arrived in that hostelry;
And after that I will tell of our journey
And all the rest of our pilgrimage.
But first I pray yow, of your courtesy,
That you do not attribute it to my rudeness,
Though I speak plainly in this matter,
To tell you their words and their behavior,
Nor though I speak their words accurately.
For this you know as well as I:
